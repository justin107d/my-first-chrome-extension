Chrome extensions only require an html and a manifest.json file but can take on more if needed.  This tutorial 
used a contentScript that interacted with elements on the tab as well as a background file that listened for a 
new page.  These files used chrome class functions to send promises back and forth between the popup and the 
webpage.
